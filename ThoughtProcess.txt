This is a simple dev log/dev diary of my thoughts as I approach this assignment. 
This will serve as a log of what I thought, what I tried, what worked, what didn't 
and will communicate to the reader the reasoning behind my choices.

Okay - so an AI endpoint - maybe a chatbot or an AI that can take in text and respond?
I can use a local endpoint, but how will the reader and EML team test it? Will they spin
up a local instance and use IP address 127.0.0.1? 

The rest of the stuff is pretty simple - make some C++ class, document it well, expose to 
blueprint. Multiple endpoints could be different bots who have different communication 
styles and voices and personas? Or different models completely so you can see what different 
things they have to say and do a comparative analysis?

Okay I am going to try a remote endpoint - essentially a web request to a URL/endpoint that will
take in the string of text as a payload (obviously with some headers, maybe optional parameters, etc)

I'm going to ask ChatGPT what it's recommendations are.

Prompt:
What are some online AI endpoints to send text to from UE4 and get text back with a response. 
Maybe an LLM or chatbot? Free please.


Okay - ChatGPT suggested:

1) Open AI - obviously
2) Cohere API
3) Hugging Face
4) NLU.ai
5) ChatGPT by Kuki AI

Also suggests:
1) Using UE4 HttpModule
2) Store keys properly
3) Monitor rate limit etc

Hmm - Nevermind we have to use UE5 right? Okay let's see...

Prompt:Will this work with UE5? Can I still use HttpModule?

ChatGPT says:
Yes, these APIs will work with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), and you can still use the HttpModule 
for sending HTTP requests.  The HttpModule is available in both UE4 and UE5 and allows you 
to make GET, POST, and other HTTP requests to interact with APIs, including AI or chatbot APIs.
-----------------------------------------------

Okay nice, let's spin it up. 

Steps I'm going to take.

1) Make a GitHub repo
2) Clone it
3) Create it a project in that directory
4) Create a basic C++ class that creates a blueprint node that accepts text and then prints it
   (just as an example of interfacing with nodes)
5) Enhance that class to take in text and then spit out the response, maybe on a UMG widget?

Let's see afterwards....

Tea break

Okay made the repo: https://github.com/AtifMahmud/UnrealAI
Going to use Unreal 5.4.4 - that was the only UE5 I have installed.

Gonna look up C++ docs and examples as I code and work on this - I don't remember some syntactic stuff
but I did C++ in the past.

Around 2123 hrs - UE still launching - obviously compile stuck at 45%

2137 hrs - finally it loaded up. 3rd person template. Let's make a C++ class (and expose it to blueprint)
Added c++ class - let me generate solution
Okay it failed to generate project files. It can't find visual studio.
Okay need to add c++ tool chain to Visual studio 2022

Okay worked - 2211 hrs - was successful in generating solution file 

Does this hour count? I was pretty much compiling.

Visual Studio says "This project is incompatible with the current version of Visual Studio" - let me see what that's about.
Okay opened with VS 2022 - now it works.

Some errors, let's see why:

- Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State	Details

Suggested to delete the .vs and Binaries and such folders - right! So I did Rebuild and clean

The errors won't go away.

Change dropdown in error list from Build + Intellisense to build only
Click Refresh visual studio project from ue5 editor tools menu

Closed VS and hit Open Visual Studio from UE5 - its opening 2019 - ah i need to set external IDE in project settings
https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/XjvJ/unreal-engine-ue-5-1-visual-studio-2022-installation-guide

This might help - still clicking on open visual studio opens 2019??

Pausing for now, will come back tomorrow - 2256 hrs
----------------------

Next day: 0915 hrs
Back to it

intellisense is being weird
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72968399/visual-studio-2022-showing-errors-for-everything
Manage NuGet and delete .vs

Rebuilding gives a lot of errors like Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State	Details
Error (active)	CS0006	Metadata file 'D:\Games\UE_5.4\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\AutomationTool\AutomationUtils\ref\AutomationUtils.Automation.dll' could not be found	CookedEditor.Automation	D:\Games\UE_5.4\Engine\Source\Programs\AutomationTool\CookedEditor\CSC	1		

deleted saved intermediary binaries and build and vs too?
https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/folders-safe-to-delete-to-recompile-everything/669919

It won't let me build or open the project even after deleting source

Deleting the project and starting again
Started again, added class, generate project files - not compiling
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with c++ instead of blueprint, that might help

Ah had to set up visual studio properly

Okay finally it's compiling

Finally it works


___________
Compilation and coding works - getting it all together


Okay needed to convert to actor to have in scene

use enhanced input because input is deprecated

having to enable input for actor

KEY: 
Getting error: Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State	Details
Error		Unable to find 'class', 'delegate', 'enum', or 'struct' with name 'FHttpResponsePtr'	MyProject	D:\Dev\UnrealAI\MyProject\Source\MyProject\Public\AAIChatBot.h	31		


Using Hugging Face: 

nice hugging face is working - i can create a network class in c++ to deal with stuff being not blueprintable -  the http stuff

	TSharedRef<IHttpRequest> Request = FHttpModule::Get().CreateRequest();
	Request->SetURL("https://api.openai.com/v1/completions");
	Request->SetVerb("POST");
	Request->SetHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
	Request->SetHeader("Authorization", "");


	TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> JsonObject = MakeShareable(new FJsonObject);
	JsonObject->SetStringField("model", "text-davinci-003");
	JsonObject->SetStringField("prompt", inputString);
	JsonObject->SetNumberField("max_tokens", 50);

	FString RequestBody;
	TSharedRef<TJsonWriter<>> Writer = TJsonWriterFactory<>::Create(&RequestBody);
	FJsonSerializer::Serialize(JsonObject.ToSharedRef(), Writer);

	Request->SetContentAsString(RequestBody);

	// Bind to response callback
	// Request->OnProcessRequestComplete().BindUObject(this, &AAIChatBot::OnResponseReceived);
	Request->ProcessRequest();
